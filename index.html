As we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same."</p>

                <p>Dear Angel, I know that right now things are tough. You are turning 23 and it comes with so much — as beautiful and mind-blowing as it is. For years you used to say you were older than you were, until last year when you finally accepted that you are still 22, and realized you still have so much time to do everything you want in life. And I want you to know that you are still going to become a billionaire, because you know it is within you.</p>
                
                <p>You have always believed in yourself. You have always been strong, humble, honest, beautiful inside and out, and incredibly smart, creative, and innovative. I am so proud of the woman you have become. I want you to come back to this message one day and say — oh my God, you did it.</p>
                
                <p>Today is February 25th 2026, and I am telling you — hold on. Everything is going to be fine. Life is a big fight but you have to keep pushing. Keep being honest, keep being humble, don't lose focus. Be studious and be the good girl you have always been. You were made for greatness Angel. Don't you ever forget that.</p>
